A Streamlit app to easily run the [ModelScope text-to-video](https://huggingface.co/damo-vilab/modelscope-damo-text-to-video-synthesis) diffusion model with customizable number of frames, fps, and dimensions.

**Built with:**
* [Huggingface Diffusers](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers)ðŸ§¨
* [Pytorch](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch)
* [Streamlit](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit)

## Install
To install, you'll need a working conda install, from either [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com) or [miniconda](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html).

1. Clone this repo.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kpthedev/ez-text2video.git
cd ez-text2video
```
2. Create the conda environment.

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yaml
```

## Running
To run the app, make sure you are in the `ez-text2video` folder, then run:

```bash
conda activate t2v
streamlit run app.py
```
This should open the webUI in your browser automatically.

> The very first time you run the app, it will automatically download the models from Huggingface. This may a couple of minutes (~5 mins).
